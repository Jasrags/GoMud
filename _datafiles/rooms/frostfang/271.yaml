zone: Frostfang
title: Soldiers Barracks
description: The main hall is lined with rows of simple, sturdy bunk beds, each neatly
  made with crisp, gray blankets and a small wooden locker at the foot for personal
  belongings. Weapons racks stand against the walls, holding an array of swords, shields,
  and spears, all polished to a shine and ready for use. The floor is bare stone,
  worn smooth by the constant tread of boots, and the walls are adorned with banners
  and insignia that represent various ranks and units within the Frostfang military.
