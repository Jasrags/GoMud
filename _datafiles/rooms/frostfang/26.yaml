zone: Frostfang
title: Dark alley
description: 'Adjacent to the Sanctuary of the Benevolent Heart, a narrow, shadowed
  alleyway snakes away from the main thoroughfare of Beggars Lane. This hidden crevice
  of Frostfang is a stark contrast to the temple''s solemnity. In the dim light of
  the alleyway, the faded colors of a mural catch your eye. It depicts a raven, its
  wings spread wide as if in flight, painted with such detail that it almost seems
  ready to leap from the wall. The raven''s eyes, crafted from a material darker and
  more lustrous than the surrounding paint, gleam with an uncanny intensity. The ground
  is uneven, littered with remnants of daily life: discarded bones from meager meals,
  worn-out shoes, and the occasional glint of a broken bottle. Faint whispers and
  the soft rustling of movement can be heard from within the shelters, hinting at
  the lives precariously balanced in this hidden enclave, a stone''s throw away from
  a place of worship and refuge.'
