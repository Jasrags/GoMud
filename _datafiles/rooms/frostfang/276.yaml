title: Residential Hedge
description: Within the hedge, the atmosphere is one of serene isolation. The foliage
  is thick and lush, absorbing sound and creating a sense of profound stillness. The
  ground, a tapestry of fallen leaves and small sprouts of grass, is soft and yielding.
  Occasional gaps in the foliage reveal glimpses of the sky above, a canvas of shifting
  clouds or twinkling stars. This hidden enclave feels like a world apart, a tranquil
  haven untouched by the passage of time.
