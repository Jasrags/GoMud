title: Frostfang Throne Room
description: The Throne Room of Frostfang Castle exudes an aura of cold majesty. High,
  vaulted ceilings loom overhead, with pale light filtering through tall windows that
  reflect the icy landscape outside. At the room's heart, on an obsidian throne elevated
  on a black marble dais, sits the king. His once-strong posture now slightly slumped,
  his face etched with lines of fatigue and eyes that speak of years battling the
  harsh elements and enemies, both external and internal. The weight of his reign,
  marked by relentless challenges, is evident in his weary demeanor. Flanking the
  throne, braziers with blue flames cast an ethereal glow, their light contrasting
  starkly with the imposing stone surroundings, underscoring the room's potent authority.
